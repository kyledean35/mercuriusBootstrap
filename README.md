# mercuriusBootstrap

This is my Bootstrap project that I worked on. I used what I learned with html, CSS, and Java to create a website for stocks and cryptocurrency information. I utilized TradingView widgets to do this. As this was my first project I focused mostly on the looks rather than the functionality. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to change the symbol of the widgets using user input but never figured it out. I was able to do it when I moved the project to React (located at github.com.kyledean35.mercuriusReact)
